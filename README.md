# Slash Commands Handler for Discord.js v13

# Global Commands
- This repository is for global slash commands aka slash commands for all guilds in which the bot has been invited with `applications.commands` scope!

# Guild Commands
- Check the `guild` branch for guild commands aka slash commands for only one guild. Best if you have a single-server/private bot!

# This branch is for Global Commands

# How to use?
- Fork this repo.
- Fill up config.js
- Fill up example.env
- Rename example.env to .env (if using replit, then use Replit Environment Variables)
- Install everything by running `npm i` in terminal.
- Start the project by running `npm run dev` in the terminal!

# Notes
- If you have a testing bot, then use `guild` commands!
- Invite your bot with `applications.commands` scope to have slash commands!
- Use `Global` commands if you have a public bot/multi-server
- Slash Commands take time to show up on every Guild!
- Global commands show up fater than Guild commands! The larger the guilds your bot is in, the more time it takes!
